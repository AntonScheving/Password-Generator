# Password-Generator

## **Introduction**

This is a HTML, CSS and JavaScript code that generates a random password based on user input. The user is prompted to enter the number of characters they want in their password between 10 and 64 characters, and to choose which types of characters they want to include (special characters, numbers, lowercase letters and/or uppercase letters).

## **How To Operate The Password Generator In The Browser**

1. When the user clicks on the 'Generate Password' button the user is prompted to enter the number of characters they want in their password, and is asked to choose a number between 10 and 64.
2. The user is prompted to confirm if they want to include special characters in their password.
3. The user is prompted to confirm if they want to include numbers in their password.
4. The user is prompted to confirm if they want to include lowercase letters in their password.
5. The user is prompted to confirm if they want to include uppercase letters in their password.
6. When the user has selected all the criteria the code generates a random password using the user's choices and the length of the password.
7. The code then displays the generated password in the browser.

## Troubleshooting

Between each password generation, you need to refresh the browser to reset the functions. Otherwise, the prompts won't take into account what type of characters you want to include or exclude from the randomly generated password.
